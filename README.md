Probabilistic Trajectory Superposition Model

Overview

This repository implements a probabilistic trajectory superposition model capable of representing the evolution of dynamic systems under uncertainty. The framework models motion as a superposition of multiple plausible trajectories, capturing both the dominant path and potential divergences due to system perturbations.

The core principle is that motion is not strictly deterministic, but has inherent variability that can be encoded, visualized, and analyzed.

Conceptual Framework

1. Branches:

Each trajectory is composed of multiple possible branches, each representing a plausible evolution.

Branches are assigned probabilistic weights (α), encoding relative likelihood.

Branches incorporate small perturbations, oscillations, and mode-dependent behaviors, which collectively represent the system’s sensitivity to initial conditions.



2. Complex Representation:

Real part: Encodes the primary motion in the space of interest.

Imaginary part: Encodes latent divergence, capturing uncertainty, sensitivity, and branching dynamics.



3. Superposition:

Branches are combined using weighted superposition.

The most probable path is derived from the real component, while the imaginary component reflects potential divergences.



4. Applications:

Any dynamic system where motion and divergence are central.

Systems with multiple interacting components, chaotic evolution, or sensitivity to small perturbations.

Real-time trajectory planning, predictive simulations, or exploration of system uncertainty.

Future Directions

Scaling to multi-object interactions: Systems with multiple interacting bodies or components.

Trajectory optimization: Coupling with AI models for real-time predictive simulations.

Probabilistic simulations of complex systems: Applying superposition to chaotic or highly sensitive systems.

Integration with control systems: Real-time adjustment of motion paths under uncertainty.

Notes

Emphasizes motion itself over deterministic description.

Framework is domain-agnostic, applicable wherever the dynamics of motion and divergence are relevant.

All code is public domain (CC0), free to adapt for research, education, or practical applications.
